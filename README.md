# Overlapping Circles

This is a simple web application built with React that implements a famous React interview question called "Overlapping Circles." The app allows users to tap or click on the screen, which creates circles with an integer value in the center. This integer value represents the number of circles that overlap with the current circle. Initially, the value is zero, but it can increase as more circles overlap.

The color of the circles also changes based on the overlap count, providing a visual representation of the overlapping behavior.
